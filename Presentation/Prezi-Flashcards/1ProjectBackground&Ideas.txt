The history of hand gesture recognition for computer control started with the invention of glove-based control interfaces back in the early '90s. 
Researchers realized that gestures inspired by sign language can be used to offer simple commands for a computer interface. 
This gradually evolved with the development of much accurate accelerometers, infrared cameras and even fibreoptic bend-sensors (optical goniometers).
Looking at the progress that was made in the last 25 years or so, the future of gesture-based technology will shortly make many controller devices 
obsolete if it hasn't done so already such as the TV remote, mouse and keyboard, gaming controllers, light switches, heating control, car keys etc.

The assignment given to us in our Gesture-Based URI module was to develop an application with a natural-user interface. This gave us a broad range of 
options to implement the app including voice-control, hand gestures and device-motion control. There were various choices to make in regards to what 
one we were going to implement, but we felt the hand-gesture controlled application was the best option for us as it is currently the most robust form 
in gesture-based technology and it has alot of development documentation online.
