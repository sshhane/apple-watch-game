The research conducted in this project was based on the Apple SmartWatch device and it's implementations in different scenarios in the real world. 
The main features of the device we investigated was the accelerometer and the gyroscope. The motion data extracted from these can alert the system to 
specific movements by the user and track the type of the user's movement aswell.

An accelerometer measures changes in velocity along one axis. All iOS devices have a three-axis accelerometer, which delivers acceleration values 
in each of the three axes x, y and z. The values reported by the accelerometers are measured in increments of the gravitational acceleration, with 
the value 1.0 representing an acceleration of 9.8 meters per second (per second) in the given direction. Acceleration values may be positive or negative 
depending on the direction of the acceleration.

A gyroscope measures the rate at which a device rotates around a spatial axis. Many iOS devices have a three-axis gyroscope, which delivers rotation 
values in each of the three axes. Rotation values are measured in radians per second around the given axis. As with the accelerometer the rotation values 
may be positive or negative depending on the direction of rotation.
